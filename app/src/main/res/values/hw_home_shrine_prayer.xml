            <i>(written by Father Kentenich in Milwaukee, May 1965)</i>
            \n
            My room (home) is your shrine,\n
            where you work to the glory of the Father.\n
            There he transforms my entire being\n
            into the Trinity’s most beloved shrine,\n
            where the sanctuary light constantly burns\n
            and the glow of love never dies;\n
            where the fire of sacrifice upon sacrifice\n
            banishes all selfishness from the heart;\n
            where roses adorn the altar\n
            and lilies never cease to bloom;\n
            where paradisal breezes waft\n
            and raise heart and mind to heaven;\n
            where the spirit of the world cannot enter\n
            as in the eternal city of Sion;\n
            where peace reigns and happiness laughs\n
            because God’s angel keeps diligent watch;\n
            where Christ rules and is triumphant\n
            and leads the whole world to the Father.
