             <small><sup>357 </sup></small>Father, after the day’s burden and toil,\n
            we come to seek rest in you,\n
            who have guided us\n
            and chosen us as instruments.\n\n

            <b>Thanksgiving</b>\n
             <small><sup>358 </sup></small>Praise and thanks be given to you,\n
            who accompanied us today\n
            and accomplished through us\n
            deeds which brought you great joy.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>359 </sup></small>Through us you added stone on stone\n
            in building up your Schoenstatt work,\n
            which you have graciously chosen\n
            to bring salvation to the whole world.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>360 </sup></small>Our Mother’s hand held us fast in loyalty,\n
            never leaving us alone,\n
            for it is to us, as the Lord’s bride\n
            that you have entrusted your work.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>361 </sup></small>All the blessings that flowed to us today\n
            and were showered upon us from the altar,\n
            carried us majestically and nobly\n
            like a mighty ocean of grace.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>362 </sup></small>You greeted us lovingly\n
            and gladdened our lives,\n
            for our Savior often stood before us\n
            in human vesture.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>363 </sup></small>Through human suffering he often called us,\n
            beckoning us to his side;\n
            he often sent us crosses\n
            and through them made us more like himself.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>364 </sup></small>May the things which gladdened you, Father,\n
            flow back to the fountain of graces\n
            which streams forth from our shrine\n
            to the honor of the Trinity.\n\n

            <b>Contrition</b>\n
             <small><sup>365 </sup></small>Father, may the Savior’s Precious Blood\n
            atone for everything\n
            which grieved your fatherly heart\n
            because we did not love you enough.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>366 </sup></small>Heed the pleas of our Mother\n
            and let her be our advocate.\n
            Kindly accept her merits\n
            and look on us with a father\'s mercy.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>367 </sup></small>Our hearts were often obstinate\n
            when the world enticed us.\n
            We were often inattentive\n
            when you expressed your wishes.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>368 </sup></small>Many hidden reservations\n
            made our hearts tired and cold,\n
            while many evil passions\n
            diminished the strength of our love.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>369 </sup></small>Often our deeds angered you\n
            and destroyed\n
            what our preaching and words\n
            had continually proclaimed.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>370 </sup></small>Often we misused our time\n
            and missed opportunities to do good.\n
            Our omissions weigh heavily upon us\n
            for they have deprived us of your grace.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>371 </sup></small>Our great ideal was therefore darkened\n
            and caused you anguish (P.I.);\n
            the day’s struggle was uninspired (P.E.)\n
            because spirit was lacking and deeds were few.\n
            <i>(Examination of conscience)</i>\n\n

            <b>Practice of Dying</b>\n
             <small><sup>372 </sup></small>The depths of our souls are laid bare\n
            before the eyes of our Lord\n
            who will one day appear as Judge\n
            and assemble us for the judgment of the world.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>373 </sup></small>We now freely detach ourselves\n
            from the things which still enslave us.\n
            In Christ and in childlike spirit\n
            we surrender ourselves entirely to you.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>374 </sup></small>We share in Christ’s death on the cross\n
            and feel the agony of his dying,\n
            just as we will at the end of our lives\n
            in the hour of the last sacrament.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>375 </sup></small>Our hands touch each of the senses.\n
            We pray that you break the chains\n
            which held them in bondage today\n
            and reduced the strength of our souls.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>376 </sup></small>We are truly sorry for our sins\n
            and immerse our guilty hearts\n
            into the ocean of your love,\n
            reconsecrating them entirely to you.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>377 </sup></small>You gave us love\n
            and we caused you sorrow.\n
            You brought us gifts\n
            and we forgot to think of you.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>378 </sup></small>As a result, what we did for souls\n
            did not take root as it should have;\n
            what we built with one hand\n
            we abruptly destroyed with the other.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>379 </sup></small>Because of our failings you look with sadness\n
            on us, to whom you gave your love,\n
            and on our shrine,\n
            our Mother’s possession.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>380 </sup></small>In the future it will be different.\n
            We will avoid all self-deception\n
            and solely follow the ideal\n
            which shines forth to us everywhere.
            \n\n
            <b>Petition</b>\n
             <small><sup>381 </sup></small>Let us rest in your protection.\n
            Be our defense and stronghold\n
            against drives and feelings\n
            and Satan’s evil play.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>382 </sup></small>Deeply fill our souls\n
            with the love that comes from you,\n
            so that we live solely for the work\n
            which lifts the world to you.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>383 </sup></small>Tomorrow let us rise at the appointed hour,\n
            refreshed and in good health,\n
            and in the spirit of service\n
            dedicate our strength and time to you.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>384 </sup></small>Mother, inscribe us in your heart\n
            and lead us with you heavenwards.\n
            We loyally renew the covenant\n
            which we sealed in that hour of grace.
            \n\n
            <b>Blessing</b>\n
             <small><sup>385 </sup></small>May God’s blessing come upon all those\n
            who have consecrated themselves entirely to Schoenstatt\n
            and bring them happiness and salvation\n
            here and in eternity.\n
            Amen.
