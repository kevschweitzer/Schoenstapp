            \n
            Accept, O Lord, my entire freedom,\n
             my memory, my understanding, my entire will\n
             and my whole heart.\n
            You have given everything to me;\n
             I give everything back to you without reserve;\n
             do with it what you will.\n
            Give me but one thing:\n
             your grace, your love, your fruitfulnessâ€”\n
            your grace,\n
             that I may joyfully submit to your wish and will;\n
            your love,\n
             that I may always believe, know\n
             and sometimes even feel\n
             that I am loved as the apple of your eye;\n
            your fruitfulness,\n
             that in you and Our Lady\n
             I may become genuinely fruitful\n
             for our common task.\n
            Then I am more than rich, and will want nothing more.\n
            Amen.
