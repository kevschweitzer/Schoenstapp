            <sup>230</sup>1. The Schoenstatt Stations of the Cross or the Way of the   Cross   of   God’s   Instruments   can,   if   desired,   be spoken or sung in alternation [left side/right side, first choir/second choir or other similar arrangement]. If spoken, it is recommended that at least the closing verse, which is repeated at the end of each station, be sung.
            \n
            <sup>231</sup>2. The two “choirs” are arranged in such a manner that the   first  choir  always    considers    Christ   from   the standpoint of the station’s event in Palestine while the second      considers     the  same    mystery     from    the standpoint of our own day and age.
            \n
            <sup>232</sup>3. If time does not allow the Stations to be prayed in their entirety, the second choir can be omitted.
            \n
            <sup>233</sup>4. Thematically speaking, the Stations are a meditation on the qualities of our instrument piety:
            \n
            <sup>234</sup>The     first  station   concerns     itself  with   perfect detachment, the second with complete attachment to the Father and the third with the attachment to one’s mission. In the fourth, fifth and sixth stations we find corresponding examples in the “apparitions”, i.e. in the lives [of Mary, Simon of Cyrene and Veronica]. The three following stations try to communicate a deeper understanding of these qualities so that the soul can come to rest in them. The tenth, eleventh and twelfth stations draw our attention to the instrument’s security in the Father rather than in sensual pleasures, selfish   willfulness   and   possessions.   The   thirteenth and fourteenth stations expound on the fruitfulness of the instrument.
            \n
            <sup>235</sup>5. At the same time, it is not difficult to use these stations to rediscover and reflect on the qualities of the Inscriptio.
            \n
            <sup>236</sup>Perfect   surrender   is   depicted   in   the   first,   perfect devotion in the second, and perfect transmission [of love] in the third station. The next three and the final five   stations   express   our   unlimited   claims   of   love, while the seventh, eighth and ninth stations—as in the above considerations on instrument piety—deepen the themes of the previous stations.
            \n
            <sup>237</sup>6. As the introductory prayer indicates, the entire Way of the Cross is a confrontation between the two great powers behind world history: on the one hand Christ and Our Lady, the permanent helpmate assigned to him by the Father, on the other hand the devil and his hosts. Between them both is the human soul. We want to be inspired to redecide wholeheartedly to serve as instruments of the divine powers.
            \n
            <sup>238</sup>Special emphasis is placed on depicting the intimate oneness of Our Lord and his Bride. As a consequence, the idea of Mary’s motherhood recedes into the background in favor of her role as the second Eve, the “One who crushes the serpent.”
            \n
            <sup>239</sup>Neither should it be overlooked how the Trinity and the work of redemption are integrated into the stations. This should awaken in us the desire to form our love of Mary in such a way that the mysteries of the Trinity and of redemption become favorites of ours, making us their zealous apostles. Then, if God wants to give us the gift of contemplation, he will find us prepared for it.

            my crucified Lord, and on your Bride.
            \n
            <sup>331</sup>Let me proclaim you both to those around me,\n
            daring my life’s battle for you each day.\n
            Then your kingdom will be victorious everywhere\n
            and extend its boundaries to the ends of the universe.
            \n
            <sup>332</sup>Let me present the cross and the picture of Mary\n
            to the nations as the sign of redemption\n
            so that the two who stand as one in the Father’s plan of love\n
            may never be divided.
            \n
            <sup>333</sup>May Schoenstatt always be your loyal instrument,\n
            inscribing your names, together, into human hearts,\n
            that Satan’s realm may truly be destroyed\n
            and in the Holy Spirit the Father’s glory be increased.\n
            Amen.
