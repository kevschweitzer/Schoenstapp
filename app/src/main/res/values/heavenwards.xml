            <b>Greeting</b>\n
            <sup>3</sup>Father, I may awake with new strength \n
            to rekindle my love.\n
            Let me joyfully greet you\n
            together with all your Schoenstatt.
            \n
            <sup>4</sup>We are united in the shrine\n
            where the flames of our hearts\n
            beat for our Mother Thrice Admirable\n
            who, through us, wants to build your kingdom.
            \n
            <sup>5</sup>We kneel in the Holy Spirit\n
            and sing jubilant hymns to Christ,\n
            who sends us with her as instruments\n
            to change the destiny of nations.\n\n

            <b>Thanksgiving</b>\n
            <sup>6</sup>We give you thanks for all the gifts\n
            which we have received in such abundance:\n
            for choosing Schoenstatt\n
            as the place of Christ’s rebirth
            \n
            <sup>7</sup>and the place where you radiate into the world\n
            the glories of our Mother,\n
            so that streams of love may pour forth\n
            to warm cold hearts.\n\n

            <b>Blank Check</b>\n
            <sup>8</sup>Use us according to your will.\n
            Through Schoenstatt may the wide halls\n
            of the holy Church be filled again\n
            and your praise resound to your throne.
            \n
            <sup>9</sup>You may use us for your work\n
            and send us crosses, suffering and hardship;\n
            whether we meet with failure or success\n
            we want to proclaim your love.\n\n

            <b>Inscriptio</b>\n
            <sup>10</sup>May what you have foreseen for us\n
            be realized in every moment of our lives.\n
            We have but a single longing:\n
            Lead us according to your wise plans.
            \n
            <sup>11</sup>Our ideal shall shine before us\n
            and form our entire lives.\n
            For this you have created us in love (P.I.);\n
            for this we strive with all our strength (P.E.).\n
            <i>(Renewal of personal ideal and particular examination)</i>
            \n
            <sup>12</sup>Let us glow like brands of fire\n
            and joyfully go forth to the nations,\n
            giving witness to redemption\n
            and jubilantly leading all people to the Triune God.\n\n

            <b>Confidence</b>\n
            <sup>13</sup>When we consider our own strength\n
            we lose all hope and confidence.\n
            Mother, we stretch out our hands to you\n
            and ask for your many gifts of love.
            \n
            <sup>14</sup>Even in storms and dangers\n
            you will always remain faithful\n
            to the covenant you have sealed with us\n
            and enriched with countless graces.
            \n
            <sup>15</sup>You will send us vocations\n
            who join us in pledging themselves for your kingdom.\n
            You will give us work and richly bless us\n
            and unite your unlimited power1 to our powerlessness.\n\n

            <b>Morning   Offering</b>\n
            <sup>16</sup>What I bear and endure,\n
            what I say and what I dare,\n
            what I think and what I cherish,\n
            all the merits that I gain,\n
            what I direct and what I conquer,\n
            all my joys and all my sorrows:\n
            what I am and what I have,\n
            I give to you as a gift of love.\n
            Use it so that the holy stream of graces\n
            flowing richly from the shrine\n
            may fill the souls of those\n
            who have given their hearts to Schoenstatt\n
            and gently lead there\n
            all those whom you wish to choose in kindness.\n
            Accept everything that our efforts may be fruitful\n
            which we dedicate to the Trinity.\n\n

            <b>Blessing</b>\n
            <sup>17</sup>May God’s blessing come upon all those\n
            who have consecrated themselves entirely to Schoenstatt\n
            and bring them happiness and salvation\n
            here and in eternity.\n
            Amen.

            We take it for granted that our love’s active dialog with God
            has a Marian character. Whether we practice this by expressly
            living    each   day   with   our   Mother     Thrice    Admirable      of
            Schoenstatt, or are satisfied when our daily life with God takes
            on a Marian hue, is a question of personal development in the
            life of grace. In either case, we must all come to the point,
            sooner or later, when we can say:

            “Let us abide in holy triple unity, and thus go in the Holy Spirit
            to the Father .”\n

            This   little   office   aims   at   promoting   and   securing   such   a
            development.   It   can   be   prayed   before   the   corresponding
            canonical hour as a preparatory prayer, for it adopts the main
            liturgical themes of the Roman Breviary and applies them to
            our original world of values. It can also be used separately as
            an office in its own right.\n

            The structure of the hours is not difficult to discern. The first
            two lines determine the theme and essence of the given hour.
            The   first   verse   considers   the   biblical   place,   the   second
            considers its unique realization in Schoenstatt and the third
            is a prayer relevant to the hour’s theme.\n

            The preparatory prayer should be prayed before each hour.
            When   prayed   in   community,   the   verses   can   be   prayed
            alternately between two choirs [e.g. left and right], with the
            first two lines said by a leader and the third and fourth verses
            recited by all. The concluding prayer [“O Triune God”] is not
            meant to be said after each hour, but only as a conclusion to
            the entire office.\n

            Meditating on the office as a whole, one can easily follow the
            course of the day in the image of the sun and symbolically
            apply it to Christ.\n

            For those who are so inclined, the time between the canonical
            hours (about three chronological hours) can be inspired by
            the chosen image of the sun or by the biblical place. This will
            appeal especially to nature lovers who are already inclined to
            follow   the   course   of   the   sun,   and   whose   symbolic   and
            religious thinking naturally applies this image to Christ. In this
            way, their attention to the course of the sun can be readily
            transformed into a living relationship with Christ. In addition,
            the references to the various biblical places, along with their
            Marian interpretation, can help foster a living relationship
            with Mary. The application of this symbolism to our shrine,
            when properly understood, can help foster a living relation-
            ship with our Mother Thrice Admirable and her shrine.
            If a common time is agreed upon, a spontaneous awareness
            can develop that our everyday lives are also spent in the
            presence of one another and with the [entire Schoenstatt]
            family. That can strengthen the sense of community, a matter
            of no small importance, especially for those working in the
            missions and the diaspora.\n\n

            <sup>230</sup>1. The Schoenstatt Stations of the Cross or the Way of the   Cross   of   God’s   Instruments   can,   if   desired,   be spoken or sung in alternation [left side/right side, first choir/second choir or other similar arrangement]. If spoken, it is recommended that at least the closing verse, which is repeated at the end of each station, be sung.

            <sup>234</sup>The     first  station   concerns     itself  with   perfect detachment, the second with complete attachment to the Father and the third with the attachment to one’s mission. In the fourth, fifth and sixth stations we find corresponding examples in the “apparitions”, i.e. in the lives [of Mary, Simon of Cyrene and Veronica]. The three following stations try to communicate a deeper understanding of these qualities so that the soul can come to rest in them. The tenth, eleventh and twelfth stations draw our attention to the instrument’s security in the Father rather than in sensual pleasures, selfish   willfulness   and   possessions.   The   thirteenth and fourteenth stations expound on the fruitfulness of the instrument.
            \n
            <sup>235</sup>5. At the same time, it is not difficult to use these stations to rediscover and reflect on the qualities of the Inscriptio.
            \n
            <sup>236</sup>Perfect   surrender   is   depicted   in   the   first,   perfect devotion in the second, and perfect transmission [of love] in the third station. The next three and the final five   stations   express   our   unlimited   claims   of   love, while the seventh, eighth and ninth stations—as in the above considerations on instrument piety—deepen the themes of the previous stations.
            \n
            <sup>237</sup>6. As the introductory prayer indicates, the entire Way of the Cross is a confrontation between the two great powers behind world history: on the one hand Christ and Our Lady, the permanent helpmate assigned to him by the Father, on the other hand the devil and his hosts. Between them both is the human soul. We want to be inspired to redecide wholeheartedly to serve as instruments of the divine powers.
            \n
            <sup>238</sup>Special emphasis is placed on depicting the intimate oneness of Our Lord and his Bride. As a consequence, the idea of Mary’s motherhood recedes into the background in favor of her role as the second Eve, the “One who crushes the serpent.”
            \n
            <sup>239</sup>Neither should it be overlooked how the Trinity and the work of redemption are integrated into the stations. This should awaken in us the desire to form our love of Mary in such a way that the mysteries of the Trinity and of redemption become favorites of ours, making us their zealous apostles. Then, if God wants to give us the gift of contemplation, he will find us prepared for it.

            <sup>334</sup>Father, help us close the gates of our senses\n
            and let bright light stream into our souls.\n
            Lead us deeply into the warm radiance of faith\n
            and into the mystery of redemption.
            \n
            <sup>335</sup>We want to quietly accompany the Redeemer\n
            as we contemplate his life in the Rosary,\n
            united with his strong Mother-Bride\n
            whom he has chosen as his helpmate.
            \n
            <sup>336</sup>Give us the grace to grasp with our hearts\n
            the message of each mystery\n
            as we hear it in the Rosary,\n
            and to form our lives accordingly.
            \n
            <sup>337</sup>Let us immerse ourselves into the ocean of love\n
            which the Rosary allows us to drink in richly,\n
            and let the glowing love of Christ and his Mother\n
            inflame our weak sacrificial spirit.
            \n
            <sup>338</sup>Then our lives will soon become a mirror\n
            of Christ’s being and living here on earth.\n
            In him we will go through the world with strength and kindness\n
            as an image of Mary bringing blessings to all.
            \n
            <sup>339</sup>Then you may always use us as instruments\n
            in your omnipotent, loving and mighty hands,\n
            and form through us, in accordance with your plan,\n
            the face of humanity today. Amen.

            <b>Introduction:</b>
            <sup>340</sup>Mother, in your life we see\n
            the vibrant flames of faith, hope and love.\n
            Let this majestic triple star\n
            shine through the dark night of our lives.
            \n
             Implore for us from the Father with your Son\n
             that God alone reign on the throne of our hearts.

            <b>The Joyful Mysteries</b>


            <b>The First Joyful Mystery — The Annunciation</b>
            <sup>341</sup>Mother, you speak your Fiat without hesitation\n
            and are allowed to bear the Savior beneath your heart.\n
            As deaconess you silently prepare the sacrificial gift\n
            according to the Father’s will.
            \n
             Draw us deeply into your mission;\n
             let us be the Redeemer’s deacon.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Second Joyful Mystery — The Visitation</b>
            <sup>342</sup>We see you, Mother, hastening with the Savior\n
            to stay with Elizabeth and serve her.\n
            She rejoices and is filled with the Holy Spirit,\n
            and feels her child sanctified in her womb.
            \n
             Let us, too, devote our strength and time\n
             in quiet service to the work of salvation.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Third Joyful Mystery — The Birth of Jesus</b>
            <sup>343</sup>In Bethlehem in a poor and little stable\n
            you give birth to the Lord of the world for us all.\n
            Just as you showed him to the shepherds and the magi\n
            and humbly bowed before him in adoration,
            \n
             let us always be his loving instruments\n
             and carry him deeply into human hearts.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Fourth Joyful Mystery — The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple</b>
            <sup>344</sup>Filled with longing for our salvation, you present in the Temple\n
            the One you conceived of the Holy Spirit.\n
            Your motherly gaze is turned to us\n
            as you return him unconditionally and entirely to the Father.
            \n
             Like you, the great servant of the sacrifice,\n
             I give everything I hold most dear for the salvation of souls.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Fifth Joyful Mystery — The Finding of Jesus in the Temple</b>
            <sup>345</sup>The Lord permits you to suffer in Jerusalem\n
            in order to prepare you for still greater sacrifices.\n
            He must handle you with such firmness\n
            so that you can one day stand beneath the cross.
            \n
             We will remain still when God wants to form us\n
             as instruments for the redemption of the world.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Sorrowful Mysteries</b>


            <b>The First Sorrowful Mystery — The Agony in the Garden</b>
            <sup>346</sup>Mother, out of love and for the world’s salvation\n
            you gave the Savior his body and life.\n
            In the garden his inner anguish causes him to sweat blood,\n
            but nothing can break his readiness to suffer.
            \n
             I, too, place all the bitter suffering of my soul\n
             ever at your disposal for the capital of grace.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Second Sorrowful Mystery — The Scourging at the Pillar</b>
            <sup>347</sup>You allow the Savior to stand at the pillar\n
            and atone for the offenses of our sensuality.\n
            Your motherly heart trembles with each blow;\n
            for us you bear with him each burst of pain.
            \n
             With both of you I offer myself to the Father\n
             as a sacrifice of justice for our times.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Third Sorrowful Mystery — The Crowning with Thorns</b>
            <sup>348</sup>Our Lord permits the executioners\n
            to crown his divine head with thorns and to mockingly scorn him.\n
            Your Fiat was a yes to this as well,\n
            because by this suffering he atoned for our arrogance.
            \n
             With joy and in apostolic spirit\n
             I offer with you my will as an instrument to Christ.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Fourth Sorrowful Mystery — Jesus Carries the Cross</b>
            <sup>349</sup>Your Fiat lets the Lord carry the cross\n
            which our dread of sacrifice has placed on him.\n
            Without bitter complaint he carries it to the place of sacrifice,\n
            urged on by redeeming love.
            \n
             I silently want to help him carry the cross,\n
             even when my feelings rise in revolt.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Fifth Sorrowful Mystery — The Crucifixion</b>
            <sup>350</sup>I see the Redeemer of the world hanging on the cross,\n
            urged thus far by the ardent longing of his love.\n
            You relinquish your motherly rights and freely offer him up\n
            that we might receive salvation and light.
            \n
             Great and holy bearer of the sacrifice,\n
             lead me to the eternal High Priest.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Glorious Mysteries</b>


            <b>The First Glorious Mystery — The Resurrection</b>
            <sup>351</sup>The Lord breaks the powerful bonds of death\n
            and crushes Satan’s power and cunning.\n
            Rejoicing, you see him transfigured and beautiful,\n
            as we will one day rise in heaven.
            \n
             Let this faith gladden my soul\n
             and make my love burn brightly.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Second Glorious Mystery — The Ascension</b>
            <sup>352</sup>The Lord has ascended into heaven,\n
            leaving behind those who hope for his coming.\n
            Your heart and eyes are filled with longing,\n
            but you rejoice in the happiness of your Son.
            \n
             May my longing always be directed to heaven\n
             that my heart become as great and wide as yours.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Third Glorious Mystery — The Descent of the Holy Spirit</b>
            <sup>353</sup>In the midst of the apostles you powerfully implore\n
            the coming of the promised Spirit,\n
            who transforms weak men and women\n
            and directs the Church on the road to victory.
            \n
             Open our souls for the Spirit of God,\n
             that he may change the course of the world.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Fourth Glorious Mystery — The Assumption</b>
            <sup>354</sup>Just as you accompanied Our Lord in this life\n
            and lived and loved and suffered with him,\n
            so, at the completion of your life,\n
            he takes you body and soul into heaven.
            \n
             With my whole heart I share in your happiness\n
             and pray that the world may enjoy a similar fate.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>The Fifth Glorious Mystery — The Coronation</b>
            <sup>355</sup>You reign now in heaven as Queen\n
            and dwell in bliss with the Triune God.\n
            With your Son you govern the world:\n
            He has chosen you to be its Mother.
            \n
             We longingly lift our hearts and hands and voices:\n
             Lead us safely into the eternal Schoenstatt Land.
            \n
            <i>(Our Father...10 Hail Marys...Glory Be...)</i>

            <b>Conclusion</b>
            <i>(at the end of the Rosary)</i>
            \n
            <sup>356</sup>Father, through the sacred mysteries of redemption\n
            grant that we may stand in grace before you.\n
            Let Schoenstatt flourish as a garden of God\n
            which touches the widest circles of the Church throughout the world,
            \n
             a garden tended by our Mother Thrice Admirable\n
             as the sunlit meadow of the Triune God.\n
            Amen.

        <item>
            <sup>357</sup>Father, after the day’s burden and toil,\n
            we come to seek rest in you,\n
            who have guided us\n
            and chosen us as instruments.
            
            <b>Thanksgiving</b>
            <sup>358</sup>Praise and thanks be given to you,\n
            who accompanied us today\n
            and accomplished through us\n
            deeds which brought you great joy.
            \n
            <sup>359</sup>Through us you added stone on stone\n
            in building up your Schoenstatt work,\n
            which you have graciously chosen\n
            to bring salvation to the whole world.
            \n
            <sup>360</sup>Our Mother’s hand held us fast in loyalty,\n
            never leaving us alone,\n
            for it is to us, as the Lord’s bride\n
            that you have entrusted your work.
            \n
            <sup>361</sup>All the blessings that flowed to us today\n
            and were showered upon us from the altar,\n
            carried us majestically and nobly\n
            like a mighty ocean of grace.
            \n
            <sup>362</sup>You greeted us lovingly\n
            and gladdened our lives,\n
            for our Savior often stood before us\n
            in human vesture.
            \n
            <sup>363</sup>Through human suffering he often called us,\n
            beckoning us to his side;\n
            he often sent us crosses\n
            and through them made us more like himself.
            \n
            <sup>364</sup>May the things which gladdened you, Father,\n
            flow back to the fountain of graces\n
            which streams forth from our shrine\n
            to the honor of the Trinity.
            
            <b>Contrition</b>
            <sup>365</sup>Father, may the Savior’s Precious Blood\n
            atone for everything\n
            which grieved your fatherly heart\n
            because we did not love you enough.
            \n
            <sup>366</sup>Heed the pleas of our Mother\n
            and let her be our advocate.\n
            Kindly accept her merits\n
            and look on us with a father\'s mercy.
            \n
            <sup>367</sup>Our hearts were often obstinate\n
            when the world enticed us.\n
            We were often inattentive\n
            when you expressed your wishes.
            \n
            <sup>368</sup>Many hidden reservations\n
            made our hearts tired and cold,\n
            while many evil passions\n
            diminished the strength of our love.
            \n
            <sup>369</sup>Often our deeds angered you\n
            and destroyed\n
            what our preaching and words\n
            had continually proclaimed.
            \n
            <sup>370</sup>Often we misused our time\n
            and missed opportunities to do good.\n
            Our omissions weigh heavily upon us\n
            for they have deprived us of your grace.
            \n
            <sup>371</sup>Our great ideal was therefore darkened\n
            and caused you anguish (P.I.);\n
            the day’s struggle was uninspired (P.E.)\n
            because spirit was lacking and deeds were few.\n
            <i>(Examination of conscience)</i>
            
            <b>Practice of Dying</b>
            <sup>372</sup>The depths of our souls are laid bare\n
            before the eyes of our Lord\n
            who will one day appear as Judge\n
            and assemble us for the judgment of the world.
            \n
            <sup>373</sup>We now freely detach ourselves\n
            from the things which still enslave us.\n
            In Christ and in childlike spirit\n
            we surrender ourselves entirely to you.
            \n
            <sup>374</sup>We share in Christ’s death on the cross\n
            and feel the agony of his dying,\n
            just as we will at the end of our lives\n
            in the hour of the last sacrament.
            \n
            <sup>375</sup>Our hands touch each of the senses.\n
            We pray that you break the chains\n
            which held them in bondage today\n
            and reduced the strength of our souls.
            \n
            <sup>376</sup>We are truly sorry for our sins\n
            and immerse our guilty hearts\n
            into the ocean of your love,\n
            reconsecrating them entirely to you.
            \n
            <sup>377</sup>You gave us love\n
            and we caused you sorrow.\n
            You brought us gifts\n
            and we forgot to think of you.
            \n
            <sup>378</sup>As a result, what we did for souls\n
            did not take root as it should have;\n
            what we built with one hand\n
            we abruptly destroyed with the other.
            \n
            <sup>379</sup>Because of our failings you look with sadness\n
            on us, to whom you gave your love,\n
            and on our shrine,\n
            our Mother’s possession.
            \n
            <sup>380</sup>In the future it will be different.\n
            We will avoid all self-deception\n
            and solely follow the ideal\n
            which shines forth to us everywhere.
            
            <b>Petition</b>
            <sup>381</sup>Let us rest in your protection.\n
            Be our defense and stronghold\n
            against drives and feelings\n
            and Satan’s evil play.
            \n
            <sup>382</sup>Deeply fill our souls\n
            with the love that comes from you,\n
            so that we live solely for the work\n
            which lifts the world to you.
            \n
            <sup>383</sup>Tomorrow let us rise at the appointed hour,\n
            refreshed and in good health,\n
            and in the spirit of service\n
            dedicate our strength and time to you.
            \n
            <sup>384</sup>Mother, inscribe us in your heart\n
            and lead us with you heavenwards.\n
            We loyally renew the covenant\n
            which we sealed in that hour of grace.
            
            <b>Blessing</b>
            <sup>385</sup>May God’s blessing come upon all those\n
            who have consecrated themselves entirely to Schoenstatt\n
            and bring them happiness and salvation\n
            here and in eternity.\n
            Amen.
