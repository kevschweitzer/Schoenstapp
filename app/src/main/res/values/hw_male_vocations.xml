            <sup>538</sup>Mother, kindly lead to us today\n
            those who are your own and whom you wish to unite in Schoenstatt.\n
            Make of them a strong Tower of David,\n
            your loyal legion in earthly battle,\n
            standing close to the Redeemer of the world\n
            and going with him the ways of the Father in the Holy Spirit.
            \n
            <sup>539</sup>Send us the priests he has chosen\n
            to serve the Schoenstatt kingdom with their entire being.\n
            Increase the ranks of the Brothers of Mary,\n
            and let them consecrate themselves to you with pure souls.\n
            Awaken for us men of knightly spirit\n
            who give their lives for the Family Work.
            \n
            <sup>540</sup>From all the nations suffering here\n
            choose the best men for yourself for the expansion of your kingdom.\n
            Take them into your hands as instruments\n
            in order to turn the destiny of the nations to the Lord.\n
            May the shoot which sprouts from Schoenstatt be fruitful everywhere,\n
            to your honor and to the glory and praise of the Blessed Trinity.
            \n
            <sup>541</sup>Accept the title Queen of the World\n
            and let us glow with ardent love for you.\n
            May the whole world be set afire for your service\n
            so that all nations find their way safely home.\n
            For your holy heart is the worldâ€™s harbor of peace,\n
            the sign of election and gateway to heaven. Amen.
