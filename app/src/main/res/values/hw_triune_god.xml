            <i>(alternate version of the Concluding Prayer of the Schoenstatt Office)</i>
            \n
            O Triune God, receive eternal praises\n
            for all your great and wondrous gifts and graces,\n
            for choosing Schoenstatt as our Mother’s throne,\n
            there to unite us deeply with your Son.\n
            Our thanks to you, in Mary you are giving\n
            to every man the pattern for his living;\n
            she is of all your creatures barring none\n
            the only jeweled mirror of your Son.\n
            With joy we offer you the jubilation,\n
            the burning love and praise of all creation;\n
            in Jesus’ name, with Mary, we adore\n
            you, Blessed Trinity, forevermore.\n
            Amen.
