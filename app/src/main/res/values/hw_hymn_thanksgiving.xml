             <small><sup>612 </sup></small>The chains have fallen!\n
            Let a song of thanksgiving\n
            jubilantly resound to heaven\n
            from all within Schoenstatt’s holy halls.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>613 </sup></small>On our difficult pilgrimage,\n
            God, to his glory and praise,\n
            has revealed to our circle\n
            his greatness and wisdom.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>614 </sup></small>The misfortunes which Satan devised\n
            in his might and treachery\n
            were transformed by the Father’s glance\n
            into our greatest fortune.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>615 </sup></small>Whatever was too earthbound in our thinking\n
            and too human in our giving of self\n
            God desired to direct upwards\n
            and anchor entirely in himself.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>616 </sup></small>We therefore stand united today,\n
            formed by God’s love,\n
            fearless in the struggle\n
            with all of Satan’s offspring,
            \n\n
             <small><sup>617 </sup></small>so that new men and women arise\n
            who are, like Christ,\n
            both free and firm on earth,\n
            in joy and in sorrow,
            \n\n
             <small><sup>618 </sup></small>interweaving with him alone\n
            the striving of their hearts,\n
            just as his Mother-Bride\n
            did while on earth.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>619 </sup></small>In thanksgiving let our souls\n
            choose the Lamb of God,\n
            espousing ourselves to him eternally\n
            and being counted among his faithful.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>620 </sup></small>Lord, is the destruction we so suddenly face\n
            a sign that you want to die again?\n
            Are the tokens of your love a search\n
            for heirs of your transfiguration?
            \n\n
             <small><sup>621 </sup></small>See here the ones who are your own!\n
            The small! The pure!\n
            Graciously unite them to yourself,\n
            revealing yourself to the world anew.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>622 </sup></small>In them you may suffer,\n
            go to battle, care for souls.\n
            Through them you prepare for yourself again\n
            the joys of the resurrection.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>623 </sup></small>Through them build\n
            the city of heavenly meadows\n
            so that all people can look up to it\n
            full of confidence.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>624 </sup></small>You may send them forth\n
            to the very ends of the earth.\n
            They pledge themselves to you today\n
            to complete your kingdom on earth.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>625 </sup></small>Mary, take this offering\n
            into your faithful, motherly hands\n
            so that until our final breath\n
            this song of thanksgiving may never end.\n
            Amen.
