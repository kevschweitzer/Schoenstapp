            <i>(prayed    by  Father  Kentenich   during   his  sermon  on Pentecost   Sunday,   1965   in   the   parish   of   St.   Michael, Milwaukee.   Cardinal   Mercier   (1851-1926)   is   partially quoted)</i>
            \n\n
            Holy Spirit,\n
            you are the soul of my soul.\n
            I humbly adore you.\n
            Enlighten me, strengthen me,\n
            guide me, comfort me.\n
            Reveal your wishes to me\n
            as far as this is in accordance\n
            with the will of the Eternal Father.\n
            Show me what Eternal Love wants of me.\n
            Show me what I should do.\n
            Show me what I should suffer.\n
            Show me what I should humbly and\n
            thoughtfully accept, bear and endure.\n
            Holy Spirit, show me your will\n
            and the will of the Father,\n
            for I want my whole life to be nothing else\n
            than a continuous, an everlasting yes\n
            to the wishes, to the will of God,\n
            the Eternal Father.\n
            Amen.
