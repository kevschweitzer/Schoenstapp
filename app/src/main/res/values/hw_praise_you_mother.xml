             <small><sup>561 </sup></small>I praise you, Mother, as your child\n
            for the gifts which loyal hearts have sent me.\n
            You have awakened them in your kindness\n
            and richly reset the table of my own.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>562 </sup></small>With gratefulness I return the offering of love\n
            into your kind and motherly hands,\n
            and pray with all my heart: Tell me how it best be shared\n
            to bring you honor and joy.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>563 </sup></small>Come, Mediatrix of all gifts and graces,\n
            with your Son accept the invitation to be our guests,\n
            tenderly uniting us with a family bond—\n
            from heart to heart and from land to land.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>564 </sup></small>We want to selflessly serve your work\n
            with steadfast hearts and joyful bearing.\n
            To you we leave the care for health and food\n
            on our pilgrimage through life.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>565 </sup></small>Such counsel Our Lord once gave to us:\n
            Seek first the kingdom of God in word and deed\n
            and the Father will grant you all other things besides;\n
            only never give him rest with your childlike plea!
            \n\n
             <small><sup>566 </sup></small>Teach us through these gifts to ascend to you\n
            and to bow in reverence before the Eternal Love\n
            which opens to us daily more and more\n
            the inexhaustible ocean of God\'s mercy.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>567 </sup></small>Implore God’s richest blessing for all those\n
            who work and sacrifice for our well-being.\n
            Grant them in the difficult paths of life\n
            a generous measure of your love and grace.\n
            Amen.
