            <sup>606</sup>Mother Thrice Admirable,\n
            let us always be your instruments,\n
            lovingly giving ourselves in your service\n
            today and forever.\n
                Use us as it pleases God,\n
                entirely for your Schoenstatt world.
            \n
            <sup>607</sup>Take possession of our hearts and wills—\n
            they are undividedly yours.\n
            They will blindly follow\n
            your every sign and word.\n
                It is your instrument’s honor and glory\n
                to belong entirely to you.
            \n
            <sup>608</sup>We are ready without reserve\n
            to serve your Schoenstatt work.\n
            Send us suffering, lead us into battle;\n
            let us win the complete victory.\n
                Give us light and strengthen our courage\n
                against the guile and rage of the devil.
            \n
            <sup>609</sup>Let us reflect your image\n
            and walk through life entirely like you:\n
            strong and noble, simple and kind,\n
            spreading love and peace and joy.\n
                In us go through our times\n
                and make them ready for Christ.
            \n
            <sup>610</sup>Whether we are threatened by the world or the devil\n
            or caught in the swirl of the tempest,\n
            you will victoriously overcome every need\n
            and grant us your unlimited power.\n
                Your heart, our gateway to heaven,\n
                will always remain our safe harbor.
            \n
            <sup>611</sup>We will never perish\n
            as long as we faithfully remain your instruments.\n
            You will help us at all times\n
            to effectively bring forth abundant fruit.\n
                With our hand in yours let us joyfully enter\n
                the eternal Schoenstatt Land.\n
            Amen.
