             <small><sup>224 </sup></small>Mother, the Lord chose you\n
            to be his helpmate for the salvation of the world.\n
            As a bride and deaconess\n
            you stand faithfully at his side at all times.\n
            In the power of your virginity\n
            you are the One who crushes the serpent.

             <small><sup>225 </sup></small>In silent service you prepare him\ngit
            as the sacrificial gift.

             <small><sup>228 </sup></small>Through you he gives as the fruit of sacrifice\n
            graces to all who seek them.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>229 </sup></small>Father, we humbly ask you:\n
            May the light of faith glow within us,\n
            that we might see our Mother clearly\n
            and place our trust in her as Mediatrix.\n
            Grant that, like her and as is pleasing to you,\n
            we are always joyfully ready\n
            to offer ourselves in selfless service\n
            as instruments for the salvation of the world.\n
            Thus may we break the power of the dragon\n
            who constantly enkindles hate and discord.\n
            We ask this through Christ, who to your glory\n
            gives us a share in his mediation.\n\n
            Amen.
