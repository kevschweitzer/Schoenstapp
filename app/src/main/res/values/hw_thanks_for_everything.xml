            <sup>559</sup>For everything, yes for everything, let me give heartfelt thanks,\n
            clinging to you, Mother, with tender love.\n
            What would have become of us without you\n
            and without your motherly care!
            \n
            <sup>560</sup>Because you delivered us from great need\n
            and bound us to yourself in faithful love,\n
            I will give you thanks, be grateful forevermore\n
            and dedicate myself to you with undivided love.\n
            Amen.
