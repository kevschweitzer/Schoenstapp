            \n
            Hail Mary,\n
            for the sake of your purity\n
            keep me pure in body and soul.\n
            Open wide to me your heart\n
            and the heart of your Son.\n
            Implore for me deep self-knowledge\n
            and the grace to persevere\n
            and remain faithful until death.\n
            Give me souls;\n
            keep all else for yourself.\n
            Amen.
