            Mother Thrice Admirable, Mother of Grace,\n
            Teach us your enemies bravely to face,\n
            Never regarding their number and might,\n
            Spreading your love over the earth’s dark night,\n
            So that the world through you made new\n
            Pay to your Son His homage due.\n
            Mother with your Child divine,\n
            Make our country wholly thine.\n
            Help that never it will cease\n
            to follow you and gain God’s peace.\n
            Mother and Child united in love\n
            will restore it with grace from above.

            Mother Thrice Admirable,\n
            teach us, your knights, how to do battle,\n
            spreading devotion to you\n
            despite the number and might of the foe,\n
            so that the world renewed through you\n
            may pay homage to your Son.\n
            Mother, with your Child from heaven,\n
            descend upon our nation’s plains,\n
            so that in following your footsteps\n
            it may find true and lasting peace.\n
            Mother and Child, united in love—\n
            through you alone can our nation be healed.
