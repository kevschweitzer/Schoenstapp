             <small><sup>552 </sup></small>In pressing need\n
            you heard my prayer,\n
            in bitter sorrow\n
            my childlike plea.\n
            Despite my failings and my guilt\n
            you answered with mercy.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>553 </sup></small>When hurt and anxious,\n
            when bombs screamed\n
            and fire threatened,\n
            you sheltered me\n
            with your might\n
            which kindly guards me.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>554 </sup></small>Through years of storm\n
            and endless peril,\n
            you faithfully\n
            and steadfastly\n
            cared for each of my own,\n
            those united with you.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>555 </sup></small>Let me give thanks\n
            and proclaim your praises\n
            to every circle,\n
            simply,\n
            always,\n
            and in the spirit of service.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>556 </sup></small>And filled with trust\n
            my only wish\n
            is to loyally fulfill\n
            the Fatherâ€™s will,\n
            even if the final judgment\n
            be upon us.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>557 </sup></small>He will guide me\n
            through every darkness\n
            and lead me by the hand,\n
            despite the turmoil of our times,\n
            homewards\n
            into the land of the Father.
            \n\n
             <small><sup>558 </sup></small>After every tear has been shed\n
            he will unite me there\n
            with those I love\n
            and have remained faithful.\n
            There we will see the Lamb\n
            and stand in the presence of God.\n
            Amen.
