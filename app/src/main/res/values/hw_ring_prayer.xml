             <small><sup>589 </sup></small>When my soul is deathly tired\n
            and my aching body begs to be spared,\n
            when my heart is filled to overflowing\n
            and tears stream forth with woeful sobs—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>590 </sup></small>When my heart is under so much pressure it could burst\n
            and every pinion of the soul hangs limp,\n
            when I still revolve too much around myself\n
            and cannot find the right way to reach out to others—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>591 </sup></small>When I seek the Father and do not find him\n
            and struggle tediously in my place in life,\n
            when dark clouds hang in every part of the sky\n
            and everything wants to powerfully push for “freedom”—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>592 </sup></small>When without my knowing my Mother leaves me\n
            and the Bridegroom goes his way without me,\n
            when I am misunderstood and avoided by my friends\n
            and they give no thought to my worries, troubles and sorrows—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>593 </sup></small>When my superiors do not give me enough attention\n
            and overlook, belittle and ignore me,\n
            when all the world casts stones at me\n
            and all my passions declare mutiny within—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>594 </sup></small>When sun, moon and stars reappear\n
            and my Bridegroom returns home from distant places,\n
            when the Mother’s arms warmly embrace her child\n
            and every chord of my soul resounds—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>595 </sup></small>When I am ever more the Father’s joy,\n
            his favorite child on his sunlit earth,\n
            when I increasingly overcome my limitations\n
            and new strength urges me to act—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>596 </sup></small>When at prayer my soul rejoices and sings\n
            and everything around me brings me joy,\n
            when I see the Schoenstatt meadow prosper in joy\n
            and all are striving at the level of the Inscriptio dedication—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>597 </sup></small>When the world entices me with siren songs\n
            and my body trembles from the lower drives of the flesh,\n
            when others try to steal my heart\n
            and stand between me and my love—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>598 </sup></small>When death wants to haunt me with its dark shadows\n
            and rob me of my strength and vigor,\n
            when demons make their last bold effort\n
            to open before me the avenging fires of hell—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
            \n\n
             <small><sup>599 </sup></small>When the Bridegroom calls me to the wedding\n
            and overwhelms me with his love in heaven,\n
            when my Mother leads her child proudly to the Father,\n
            the child who prepared him such joy while on earth—\n
                Then my little ring calls out to all my drives:\n
                “The hour of your love has come!”
