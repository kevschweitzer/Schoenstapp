            \n
            The things I suffer and I bear,\n
            The things I say and what I dare,\n
            Whate’er I think, whate’er I love,\n
            The merits coming from above,\n
            What I take on, am fighting for,\n
            What brings me joy, inflicts a sore,\n
            My very life and all I have\n
            I give to you as a gift of love—\n
            To swell the stream of heavenly grace\n
            That’s flowing from your holy place,\n
            To fill with Schoenstatt zeal all those\n
            Who at your feet their hearts repose,\n
            To gently lead all to the the Shrine\n
            Who will be yours by choice benign;\n
            That our every word and every deed\n
            May please the Triune and succeed.
