            <sup>386</sup>Accept, O Lord, through my Motherâ€™s hands,\n
            the entire gift of my royal freedom.\n
            Accept my memory, my senses and my mind,\n
            accept everything as a pledge of love.
            \n
            <sup>387</sup>Accept my whole heart and my whole will\n
            so that my genuine love find satisfaction.\n
            My greatest joy is to return to you\n
            everything you have given me without reserve.
            \n
            <sup>388</sup>Use all of it in whichever way you please;\n
            I only ask that you let me love you.\n
            Help me to believe both far and near\n
            that you love me as the cherished apple of your eye.
            \n
            <sup>389</sup>Grant me the graces that will powerfully carry me\n
            to face the things I cannot dare on my own;\n
            grant me a share in the fruitfulness\n
            which your love bestows on your Bride.
            \n
            <sup>390</sup>Let me become fruitful for Schoenstatt\n
            and let my life became a creative Yes\n
            for everything you have planned in kindness\n
            for the salvation of souls through Schoenstatt.
            \n
            <sup>391</sup>Then I am rich, abundantly rich;\n
            no greater happiness could be mine.\n
            There is nothing more I could desire:\n
            I accept and love whatever you decide.
            \n
            <sup>392</sup>My Lord and my God, take everything that hinders me\n
            and everything that diminishes my great love for you.\n
            Give everything that increases my love for you\n
            and take from me my very self if it disturbs this love.\n
            Amen.
