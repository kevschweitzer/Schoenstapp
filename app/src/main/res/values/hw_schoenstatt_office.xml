            We take it for granted that our love’s active dialog with God
            has a Marian character. Whether we practice this by expressly
            living    each   day   with   our   Mother     Thrice    Admirable      of
            Schoenstatt, or are satisfied when our daily life with God takes
            on a Marian hue, is a question of personal development in the
            life of grace. In either case, we must all come to the point,
            sooner or later, when we can say:\n\n

            “Let us abide in holy triple unity, and thus go in the Holy Spirit
            to the Father .”\n\n

            This   little   office   aims   at   promoting   and   securing   such   a
            development.   It   can   be   prayed   before   the   corresponding
            canonical hour as a preparatory prayer, for it adopts the main
            liturgical themes of the Roman Breviary and applies them to
            our original world of values. It can also be used separately as
            an office in its own right.\n\n

            The structure of the hours is not difficult to discern. The first
            two lines determine the theme and essence of the given hour.
            The   first   verse   considers   the   biblical   place,   the   second
            considers its unique realization in Schoenstatt and the third
            is a prayer relevant to the hour’s theme.\n\n

            The preparatory prayer should be prayed before each hour.
            When   prayed   in   community,   the   verses   can   be   prayed
            alternately between two choirs [e.g. left and right], with the
            first two lines said by a leader and the third and fourth verses
            recited by all. The concluding prayer [“O Triune God”] is not
            meant to be said after each hour, but only as a conclusion to
            the entire office.\n\n

            Meditating on the office as a whole, one can easily follow the
            course of the day in the image of the sun and symbolically
            apply it to Christ.\n\n

            For those who are so inclined, the time between the canonical
            hours (about three chronological hours) can be inspired by
            the chosen image of the sun or by the biblical place. This will
            appeal especially to nature lovers who are already inclined to
            follow   the   course   of   the   sun,   and   whose   symbolic   and
            religious thinking naturally applies this image to Christ. In this
            way, their attention to the course of the sun can be readily
            transformed into a living relationship with Christ. In addition,
            the references to the various biblical places, along with their
            Marian interpretation, can help foster a living relationship
            with Mary. The application of this symbolism to our shrine,
            when properly understood, can help foster a living relation-
            ship with our Mother Thrice Admirable and her shrine.
            If a common time is agreed upon, a spontaneous awareness
            can develop that our everyday lives are also spent in the
            presence of one another and with the [entire Schoenstatt]
            family. That can strengthen the sense of community, a matter
            of no small importance, especially for those working in the
            missions and the diaspora.\n
