            With heartfelt love, I thank you, Mother dear,\n
            with you to guide me I need have no fear.\n
            When all around seemed dark and drear and gray,\n
            you stood as beacon for a brighter day.\n
            Your smile illumined every wakeful hour,\n
            you did uphold me with your gentle power.\n
            Thanks, a thousand thanks to you, to God shall be\n
            now and for all eternity.\n
            Amen.
