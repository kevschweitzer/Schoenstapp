            Do you know the land guided by God\n
            and deeply touched by Christ’s suffering:\n
            where hearts generously reach beyond themselves\n
            and courageously bear Christ’s suffering;\n
            where they answer in love\n
            when God wants to trim the vine;\n
            where the burden of the cross increases love\n
            and bestows the world with saints?\n
              This wonderland is known to me—\n
              It is the meadow radiantly lit by Tabor’s sun,\n
             where our Three times Admirable Lady reigns\n
              in the midst of her favorite children,\n
              loyally rewarding each gift of love\n
             with the manifestation of her glory\n
              and immeasurably abundant fruitfulness:\n
              It is my home, my Schoenstatt Land!
